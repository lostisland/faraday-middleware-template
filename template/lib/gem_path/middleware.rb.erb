  module <%= modules.last %>
    # This class provides the main implementation for your middleware.
    # Your middleware can implement any of the following methods:
    # * on_request - called when the request is being prepared
    # * on_complete - called when the response is being processed
    #
    # Optionally, you can also override the following methods from Faraday::Middleware
    # * initialize(app, options = {}) - the initializer method
    # * call(env) - the main middleware invocation method.
    #   This already calls on_request and on_complete, so you normally don't need to override it.
    #   You may need to in case you need to "wrap" the request or need more control
    #   (see "retry" middleware: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-retry/blob/41b7ea27e30d99ebfed958abfa11d12b01f6b6d1/lib/faraday/retry/middleware.rb#L147).
    #   IMPORTANT: Remember to call `@app.call(env)` or `super` to not interrupt the middleware chain!
